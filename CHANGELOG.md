All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **Node.js 20 → 22 LTS**: Upgraded Docker images, CI workflows, and engine requirements to Node.js 22 LTS (supported until April 2027)
- Closed Dependabot PR #4 (Node 25 — not LTS) and PR #6 (Python 3.14 — still in beta)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **LAN Access & SSL Configuration**: Configurable `SSL_DOMAIN` env var for self-signed certificates covering nip.io domains, enabling LAN access from mobile/other devices
- **SSL cert sharing**: Web container now uses ssl-init certificates via `--experimental-https-key`/`--experimental-https-cert`, ensuring consistent certs across API and Web
- **Documentation**: Added section 4.4 "LAN Access & SSL Configuration" in Getting Started guide

### Fixed

- **Token tracking upsert**: Replaced two-step UPDATE-then-INSERT with PostgreSQL native `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for atomic, race-condition-free token summary persistence
- **Tracking resilience**: Token tracking failures no longer break the chat flow (graceful error handling in `TrackingContext.commit()`)
- **WebSocket HMR refresh loops**: Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS` format — must be hostname only (e.g., `192.168.1.100.nip.io`), not full URL with protocol/port
- **SSL key permissions**: Changed key.pem to 644 so non-root containers (Next.js `node` user) can read it

### Changed

- `.env.example` is now a development template (was production), `.env.prod.example` remains the production template
- `generate-certs.sh` is fully configurable via `SSL_DOMAIN` and `SSL_IP` env vars (no hardcoded IP)
- Frontend dependencies updated: Next.js 16.1.6, i18next 25.8.18, lucide-react 0.577.0, tailwindcss 4.2.1

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-13

First public open-source release of LIA.

### Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph-based pipeline with Router, Planner, Orchestrator, and Response nodes
- **16+ Domain Agents**: Contacts, Email, Calendar, Drive, Tasks, Weather, Wikipedia, Perplexity, Brave Search, Web Search, Web Fetch, Places, Routes, Reminders, Context, Query, and dynamic MCP agents
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: 6 interaction types — Plan Approval, Clarification, Draft Critique, Destructive Confirm, FOR_EACH Confirm, Modifier Review
- **Smart Planner**: LLM-based execution plan generation with dependency graphs and wave-by-wave parallel execution
- **Plan Pattern Learner**: Redis-based Bayesian learning; high-confidence patterns (>=90%) bypass semantic validation
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Admin MCP (persistent) + Per-User MCP (ephemeral) with OAuth flow support
- **MCP Apps**: Interactive HTML widgets in sandboxed iframes via PostMessage JSON-RPC bridge
- **Excalidraw Integration**: LLM-driven diagram builder with intent-based element generation
- **Skills System**: agentskills.io standard SKILL.md files with per-user toggle and deterministic bypass strategies
- **Multi-Channel Messaging**: Generic abstraction with Telegram as first implementation (webhook, OTP binding, voice)
- **Autonomous Heartbeat**: LLM-driven proactive notifications with two-phase approach (decision + personality-aware rewrite)
- **Voice Mode**: TTS (Edge/OpenAI/Gemini) + STT (Sherpa-onnx Whisper, CPU-only)
- **Multi-Provider LLM**: 6 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Ollama) with dynamic config via Admin UI
- **Multi-Provider Connectors**: Google, Apple iCloud, and Microsoft 365 with mutual exclusivity per functional category
- **Scheduled Actions**: User-scheduled deferred task execution
- **Session-based Auth (BFF)**: HTTP-only cookies in Redis, no JWT exposed to frontend
- **Enterprise Observability**: OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Langfuse LLM analytics
- **Internationalization**: 6 languages (fr, en, es, de, it, zh)
- **Multi-arch Docker**: `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` builds for Raspberry Pi deployment
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 2,300+ tests (unit, integration, e2e, benchmark)

### Infrastructure

- FastAPI 0.128 backend (Python 3.12+) with async SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg
- Next.js 16 frontend (React 19, TypeScript) with TailwindCSS 4
- PostgreSQL 16 (+ pgvector) for data and vector search
- Redis 7 for sessions, cache, distributed locks, and pattern learning
- APScheduler for 9 background jobs
- Circuit breaker, rate limiting, and distributed locks
- SOPS/Age encryption for secrets management
