/**
 * Centralized landing page statistics.
 * Single source of truth consumed by HeroSection (trust badges), ProofSection
 * (animated counters + engineering proof) and JsonLd (SEO feature list).
 *
 * Verified against the codebase (2026-07):
 * - agents: 17 statically registered domain agents (infrastructure/startup/
 *   agents.py, ADR-123) + MCP iterative agent + sub-agents → "19+" is the
 *   defensible public claim
 * - tools: ToolManifest entries across src/domains/agents/{domain}/catalogue_manifests.py
 * - providers: ProviderType Literal in infrastructure/llm/providers/adapter.py
 *   (openai, anthropic, deepseek, perplexity, ollama, gemini, qwen)
 * - metrics: Prometheus metric definitions in infrastructure/observability/
 * - tests: backend pytest (~11,900 collected) + frontend vitest (1,222)
 * - adrs: docs/architecture/ ADR files (123 files, numbered up to ADR-130)
 * - releases: CHANGELOG.md release entries
 * - auditScore/auditAreas: technical audit V11 of the 2026-07-16 snapshot
 *   (released as v1.25.0) — 24 normalized areas mapped to ISO/IEC 25010:2023,
 *   arithmetic mean 199/240 = 8.3/10, security out of scope. Full public
 *   report + protocol: docs/audit/ (AUDIT_REPORT_URL below). The i18n key
 *   landing.transparency.p2_t carries the locale-formatted display value and
 *   must be updated in the 6 locales whenever auditScore changes.
